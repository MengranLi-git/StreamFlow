Daily discharge from 27 gauging stations on 6 rivers during 1980-2020.

|River|Number of Stations|
|---|---|
|Mississippi River| 8 stations|
|Des Moines River| 5 stations|
|Illinois River| 3 stations|
|Iowa River| 5 stations|
|Minnesota River| 4 stations|
|Wapsipinicon River| 2 stations|

We selected data in `June, July and August`. The annual maxima occurred in these three months. Thus **N = 40×92 = 3680**, that is, 40 years of 92 daily observations
in each station.

# Aim and Framework

## Aim

Study the dependence in the river network

## Framework

- Exploratory data analysis to check the data pattern

- Marginal fitting to check the trend

- Declustering to eliminate temporal cluster and exact flood events

- Joint fitting to check the asymptotic dependence

  - Extremal coffecients based on madogram
  
  - Extremal coffecients based on bivariate Hüsler–Reiss distribution
  
  - Hydrological distances and Euclidean distances

# EDA

```{r, fig.height=4}
data <- data %>% filter(Month %in% 6:8)
data$station <- rep(new$site_no,each = 3680)
data <- data[Q >= 0]

data_plot <- data[, c("station", "Q", "DecYear", "Month")]

data_plot$Month <- as.factor(data_plot$Month)

data_plot %>% group_by(DecYear, Month) %>%
  summarise(meanQ=mean(Q)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=DecYear,y=meanQ,group=Month, color = Month), color = Month)+
  geom_line()
```

-  We explored the annual mean discharges grouped by month. 

-  The plot shows that there is no obvious trend, except that it was unusually high in 1992. 

-  The annual mean discharges grouped by stations also have no obvious trends.

---

# Marginal Fitting

Before fitting the multivariate dependence model, we assess the univariate tail behaviour at individual gauging stations

.pull-left[
- To check the dependence 

- To obtain the constants $\mu,\ \sigma,\ \xi$

```{r}
maxi <- data %>% 
  group_by(station, DecYear) %>% 
  summarise(maxQ=max(Q))

maxi %>%
  filter(station == "05211000") %>% 
  dplyr::select(DecYear, maxQ) %>% 
  head() %>%
  kable()
```
]

.pull-right[

- We take the annual maxima and fit the GEV model.

- We fit the stationary model, single trend model and double trend model, respectively.

- We use the AIC as the model selection criteria and use the likelihood ratio test to check the significance. 

- The results show that the stationary models are best for all stations.

# Decluster

## extraction of events
data <- data %>% select(Date, Q)
data$station <- rep(new$site_no,each = 3680)
data <- data %>% spread(station, Q)

StsChos <- c(1:27)
NoSt <- length(StsChos)

Years <- unique(as.numeric(substr(data$Date,1,4)))
StNames <- as.character(StsChos)
YearsWithEvent <- numeric()
AllEvMat <- matrix(0,length(StNames),1)
AllRes <- list()
for (i in 1:length(Years)){
  # events in the i^th year at each station
  Res <- ObtainMultVarEvents(TSs=data,U=0.1,Lag=4,Year=Years[i],StNames=StNames,Plotting=0,mfrow=c(NoSt,1))  ## For Censored Likelihood
  Events <- Res$AllEvMat
  Locations <- Res$Location
  if (length(Events)>0) {
    YearsWithEvent <- c(YearsWithEvent,rep(Years[i],dim(Events)[2]))
    AllEvMat <- cbind(AllEvMat,Events)
  }
  AllRes[[i]] <- Res 
}

DataEvents <- t(AllEvMat[,-1])
rownames(DataEvents) <- YearsWithEvent
```

Extreme discharges at a given station occur in clusters due to temporal dependence, which must be removed for spatial modelling.

This step is to remove the clusters due to temporal dependence and identify the flood events for gauging stations to check the dependence.

1. To identify nonoverlapping windows of length $p$ days in each of the 40 summer periods.

2. To consider the day with the highest rank across all 27 series

3. To take a window of p days centred upon the chosen day and form an event by taking the largest observation for each series within this window

4. To delete the data in this window and then repeat the process of forming events, stopping when no windows of p consecutive days remain

# Flood Events

.pull-left[
```{r}
head(DataEvents[,1:3],20) %>% kable()%>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```
]

.pull-right[

For example, there are 9 flood events in 1980. We extract the data at each 27 station in the same day.


There are 356 events during the 40 years, thus the number of event data is $356\times27=9612$

# Joint Fitting

- asymptotic dependence

- extremal coefficients $\hat\theta$, Madogram-based estimates

- extremal coefficients $\hat\theta_{HR}$, fit the bivariate Hüsler–Reiss distribution

Hüsler–Reiss distribution approximates the extremal dependence of the data well.

We apply the `Hydrological distances` and `Euclidean distances`.

The coordinates of altitude weighted center at stations 14, 15, 16 are abnormal, and the three stations are out of the main stream, thus we remove the three stations.
