-  Do we have data for almost every day within the months?

There is $40\times365=14600$ days. Therefore we should have $671\times14600=9796600$ observations. Acturally we have $9559629$ observations, in the condition of deleting some data. The propotion is $9559629/9796600\times100\%=97.58\%$, which is acceptable in my view.



```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
setwd("F:\\StreamFlow")
load("Stream.Rdata")
Siteinfo %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~dec_lon_va,
    lat = ~dec_lat_va,
    radius = ~5,
    stroke = FALSE,
    fill = TRUE,
    fillOpacity = 0.4
  )%>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.NatGeoWorldMap")
```
