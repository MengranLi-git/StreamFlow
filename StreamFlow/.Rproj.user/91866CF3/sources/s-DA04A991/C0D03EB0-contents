# River Network

- $D_i$: index set of river segments downstream of $t_i$

- river connected: $D_i \subseteq D_j$ or $D_j \subseteq D_i$

- river distance $d(t_1, t_2)$: shortest distance along the river network

### Distance

- River distance: 

$$\Gamma_{Riv}(t_i,t_j)=1-\prod{\sqrt\pi(1-d(t_i,t_j)/\tau)}$$

- Hydrological distance:

$$\Gamma_{Euc}(t_i,t_j)=\Vert R·H(t_i)-R·H(t_j)\Vert$$
$H(t)$: altitude weighted centroid

$R$: anisotropy matrix

# Event

### Declustering

- replace each observation by its rank within its series

- consider the day with the highest rank across all series

- choosing this day randomly if it is not unique 

- take a window of p days centred upon the chosen day, and form an event by taking the largest
observation for each series within this window

- delete the data in this window

repeat the process of forming events
  
stopping when no windows of p consecutive days remain.

$Y_{4600\times31}$ (31 stations, 50 years (Jun, July, Aug), 4600 days) $\to$ $Y_{428\times31}$

# Marginal Fitting

Model 1:

- GEVD to estimate $\mu,\sigma,\xi$

- take the estimation as initial value to fit joint poisson process

the basin can be split into 4 regions.

Model 2: 

-  Covariate: latitude, size, mean altitude, mean slope (significant, LLR test)

-  Region 1, 2, 3, 4

Compare

M1: $31\times3=93$   M2: $4\times7=28$

marginal fitting to ungauged locations on the network

Computation return levels throughout river network

# Joint Fitting

- asymptotic dependence

- extremal coefficients $\hat\theta$, Madogram-based estimates

- extremal coefficients $\hat\theta_{HR}$, fit the bivariate Hüsler–Reiss distribution

Hüsler–Reiss distribution approximates the extremal dependence of the data well.

1. Marginal empirical distribution functions to transform the distribution at each gauging station to standard Pareto

1. Fitting of the max-stable process on river network

# Joint Fitting

$\Gamma_1:$ the stationary variogram based on Euclidean distances with anisotropy matrix

$$\Gamma_1(s,t)=\Vert R·(s-t)\Vert$$

$\Gamma_2:$ a variogram using the transformation H to hydrological locations

$$\Gamma_2(s,t)=\Vert R·\{H(s)-H(t)\}\Vert$$

$\Gamma_3:$ a variogram that includes the hydrological properties of the river network for flow-connected locations

$$\Gamma_3(s,t)=\lambda\Gamma_{Riv}(s,t)+\lambda_{Euc}\Vert R·H(t)-R·H(s)\Vert^\alpha$$

$\Gamma_4:$  without anisotropy

$$\Gamma_4(s,t)=\lambda\Gamma_{Riv}(s,t)+\lambda_{Euc}\Vert H(t)-H(s)\Vert^\alpha$$

# Joint Fitting

   - spectral estimation $\hat\theta_{SPEC}$ as initial value

   - censored estimation $\hat\theta_{CENS}$

process $\eta_\Gamma$; exponent measure $V_{\Gamma,t}$

Groups of 3, 5, 15, 31 stations

transform the standard Frechet margins to GEVD and compute data quantiles

# Our data

- Replace precipitation with altitude

- Define river network
